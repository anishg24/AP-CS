# AP-CS
This is my repository with all my classwork and projects for my AP Computer Science A class.

If you are here to see what I'm doing, go through the `src/` folder.

If you are one of my classmates, please don't just copy and paste, programming is fun and when you do it you'll really come to enjoy it. 
If you have any questions you can ask me or the teacher, don't just blindly copy the code.
